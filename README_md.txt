  	Overview:  
  GitHub is a great way to share your coding accomplishments. Today youâ€™ll write a README.md file that summarizes what your Ops 201 repo is all about.  

  	Objectives:  
  Write a README.md that explains your repo.  
  Publish it.  
  	Tasks:  
  Your scripting and automation challenges for Ops 201 are finished. Nice Work!  

  	Write a README.md that explains your repo. Answer the following in your README.md:  
  		1. What is this repo all about?  
  		2. Why are you learning these skills?  
  		3. What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?  
  		4. What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?  
  		5. How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?  
  		6. What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?  
  		7. What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?  
  	Publish it.  

1. My repo is filled with different examples of scripts and are useful references to go back to for possible real world situations.  
2. I'm learning these skills and abilities to help me be more knowledgeable and versed in the IT Workforce.  
3. I've learned Bash, Shell, Powershell, and the various commands, functions, and variables used within them. I also learned different things about Installing, Configuring, and Troubleshooting Microsoft Windows 10 Professional X64 22H2 and Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS.  
4. Creating a script that detects if a file or directory exists, and creates them if it does not exist. It was both frustrating and satisfying to work on it and finally have it work.  
5. It can reduce bodily fatigue by both automating repetitious commands, decreasing poor body posture, decrease exposure to "Blue Light", and have multiple various tasks running at the same time, thereby increasing work output.
6. I would improve on the automation and application of various OS Installs.
7. I want to continue to learn and improve learning Bash.
