Create a Powershell script that performs these operations on separate lines.
The overall script is not designed to operate holistically, but rather act 
as a reference for how to execute various interesting operations with the 
process family of Powershell commandlets. Clearly indicate with 
comments each component below.
---------------------------------------------------
Remember to follow this class’s commenting requirements on all scripts.

your desktop named errors.txt.
3: Print to the screen all events with ID of 16 from the System event log.

log.’
5: Print to the screen all sources of the 500 most recent entries in the
